\section{Determination of optimal intervention strategies}

This section focuses on determination of intervention strategies for pumps of the PS. Other assets such as electrical assets and assets belong to FDAS system are not part of the analysis because they are utmost critical assets that require to provide adequate level of services at all time. Intervention strategies for electrical assets and FDAS assets are suggested to follow replacement schedule defined by the manufacturers.
%

\subsection{Reliability}
With the historical data given (refer to Table \ref{noofintervention}), it is not possible to precisely quantify the reliability for each pump. Thus, In order to more or less estimate the reliability, obtaining knowledge and experience of the end-users becomes important.

Following tables present the failure statistics on pump components

\input{tables/ch05_tbl_failuredata}


With so few data points, it is bias to use the data for determine the true parameter values of the Weibull model ($\eta$ and $\beta$). However, for the sake of future implementation, this section still shows the Weibull's parameter values estimated from the data provided in Table \ref{ch05_tbl_failuredata}

Figure \ref{ch05_fig_reliability_coupling} shows the


\input{figures/ch05_fig_reliability_coupling}


\input{figures/ch05_fig_reliability_mechseal}



\input{figures/ch05_fig_reliability_bearing}



%As can be seen from the figure,

\subsection{Impacts}
Impacts are costs or loss of benefits incurred to the Client and users. Impacts are incurred by execution of PI or CI and by disruption to the operation of the PS.

Impacts incurred by execution of PI can be estimated based on, for example, conceptual design with the ballpark estimate. However, impacts incurred by execution of a CI is not easy to obtain due to lack of historical data. This is similar to the estimation of impacts such as loss in revenue, reputation, and regulatory.

Fortunately, from mathematical view point, the optimization model presented in subsection \ref{blockreplace} will be only dependent on the ratio between CI and PI. This means that we can make assumption on the ratio between CI and PI based on holistic approach. For example, if the PI is 10 millions PHP and CI is 20 million, the ratio would be CI/PI =2, and the model will determine the optimal time window (T) to execute the PI. This time window T will not change as long as the ratio between CI/PI is the same.

Values of revenues incurred by execution on respective pumps shall be calculated based on assumption on maintainability (e.g. duration of CI execution to fix the pump). Reputation and regulatory are not straightforward to estimate in monetary units, however, they can be assumed to be measured by "Willingness to Pay".

It is assumed in the estimation that the ratio between PI/CI is 0.2, which infers that the when there is a failure, the corrective intervention cost is 5 times higher than that of the preventive intervention.

The discount factor used in the study is 8.5\% annually as confirmed by Maynilad.


\subsection{Optimal Time Window and Impacts}
Figure \ref{ch05_fig_ois} presents a collection of curves representing Optimal Time Window (OTW) and impacts incurred by executing PIs on respective assets.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\linewidth}

	\caption*{c - Bearing}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Impact curves}
\label{ch05_fig_ois}
\end{figure}

The curves are with parabolic shapes, except for that of the coupling, with a minimal point representing the optimal point obtained by the model. Shapes of the curves prove following important conclusions

\begin{itemize}
\item If a PI is executed too often, the failure probability will be decreased, however, at the same time, more money is to spend on intervention activities. It will be a waste of resources to follow a program that triggers PIs;
\item The impact will decrease as the OTW increases to the optimal point and then go upward indicating that if a PI is executed beyond a certain reliability threshold, failure probability will increase, leading to more sudden failures that require to execute CIs and higher loss (e.g. the 3 Rs).
\end{itemize}

Summary of the reliability and LCC analysis are shown in Table \ref{ch05_tbl_ois}.

\input{tables/ch05_tbl_ois}

Following can be interpreted from the values shown in the Figures and the Table.

\paragraph{\underline{Coupling}}

\begin{itemize}
\item There are only 3 data points recorded to date on coupling for this PS. Values of data points are enormously different, inferring that there has been abnormal events or operation procedure leading to the failure of coupling. In this respect, data points cannot be considered as random and thus it it not recommended to be used for determination of optimal intervention strategy. This is also confirmed by the life cycle cost curve with lowest point goes even beyond 10'000 hours;
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\underline{Mechanical seal}}
\begin{itemize}
\item The optimal time to execute replacement for the mechanical seal is at 1'139 hours of operation. The corresponding value of lowest impact is $3.31x10^{-4}$ for an hour. %If the value of PI is 200'000 Peso, the CI would be 1'000'000 Peso and the average hourly impact would be $3.31x10^{-4}$*1'000'000=330 Peso. This is equivalent to 2'851'200 Peso annually (330x24x)
\item If the PI is executed at an interval of more than 3'000 hours, the impact becomes high but slowly converge to a constant. This can be understood that after 3'000 hours, it is almost certain that the seal will be failed with high probability and thus it is no different between PI and CI.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\underline{Bearing}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The optimal time to execute replacement for the bearing is at 1'875 hours of operation. The corresponding value of lowest impact is $4.18x10^{-4}$ for an hour. %If the value of PI is 200'000 Peso, the CI would be 1'000'000 Peso and the average hourly impact would be $3.31x10^{-4}$*1'000'000=330 Peso. This is equivalent to 2'851'200 Peso annually (330x24x)
	\item If the PI is executed at an interval of more than 2'000 hours, the impact becomes high but slowly converge to a constant. This can be understood that after 23'000 hours, it is almost certain that the seal will be failed with high probability and thus it is no different between PI and CI.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sensitivity analysis}
As a matter of fact, results of the optimization model are subjected to uncertainties with model's parameters and variables. Model's parameters are deterioration parameters $\eta$ and $\beta$ and impacts that should be obtained from historical data.

This subsection provides results of sensitivity analysis (SA) conducted on Weibull parameters $\eta$ and $\beta$ and the ratio between PI and CI. A SA was conducted by running the targeted parameter in a pre-defined range while keeping other parameters constant.

Results of the SA on parameter $\eta$, $\beta$, and $\frac{PI}{CI}$ are shown in Figure \ref{ch05_fig_sa_eta}, Figure \ref{ch05_fig_sa_beta}, and Figure \ref{ch05_fig_sa_pici}.

\input{figures/ch05_fig_sa_eta}

\input{figures/ch05_fig_sa_beta}

\input{figures/ch05_fig_sa_pici}


\section{Return on Investment}
It is important to note that in asset management context, the Return on Investment (ROI) is understood different from the ROI used for CAPEX projects. In CAPEX project, ROI is a ratio between the Net Present Value (NPV) of benefits (e.g. positive sum of cash flow) incurred over a pre-defined life cycle of a project (e.g. 20 or 30 years), at which there is a salvage value of the facility.

In asset management context, the ROI encompasses the ROI used in CAPEX project. This can be obviously seen in the impact curves shown in Figure \ref{ch05_fig_ois}. If the owner follows the optimal time window defined to execute a PI on any individual pump, the return on investment compared to other strategy that follow different time window is the difference of the impacts.

If the Owner expects a 5 years intervention program, it equivalents to a program that combines inspection and testing and spare part replacement.

For example, if the Owner believes that the mechanical seal follows the Weibull's model with parameters shown in Table \ref{ch05_tbl_ois}, it means that the optimal replacement would be at 1'139 hours. This infers that within 5 years plan, there will be 38 times to replace mechanical seal ($\frac{5 \times 365 \times 24}{1'139}=38$). Similarly, the numbers of replacement for bearing will be 26 times ($\frac{5 \times 365 \times 24}{1'675}=26$).

Given this background and under maintenance constraint, it might be optimal to combine the two intervention types of coupling and mechanical seal by simply looking at the behavior of the life cycle cost curves. By combining the two curves, the average point can be used to decide the intervention time window for the combination of intervention types. This infers that the OTW will be in between 26 times and 38 times. Figure \ref{ch05_fig_mixIS} shows the combination of the two curves (coupling and bearing), which give the OTW of 1'289 hours, inferring that within 5 years plan, there should be 34 times of replacement for both coupling and bearing (($\frac{5 \times 365 \times 24}{1'289}=34$)).

\begin{figure}[h]
	%	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width =\textwidth]{figures/ch05_fig_mixIS}
	%	\end{center}
	\caption{Mix intervention types}
	\label{ch05_fig_mixIS}

By multiplying the numbers of replacement times in 5 years with total numbers of pumps in operation, the expected number of spare parts to be stocked in 5 years can be straightforward to be estimated.

This exercise gives a complete and scientific way on how to determine the intervention program for 5 years (or for any number of years). It is up to the owner to decide on the next step. However, to the best of the knowledge obtained from limited data, it is optimal to continue monitoring the failures of assets rather than executing an intervention strategy that contains a high level of uncertainty.
