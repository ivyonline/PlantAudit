}{% the abstract

%The station was received a major rehabilitation/upgrade in 2017, thus, there has not progressive deterioration and degradation observed to date. The study was based on preliminary assessment on historical corrective and preventive intervention records prior to 2017 together with the operational data. %, a certain degree of degradation has been observed for pumps.%, which experienced high frequency of failure on bearing and coupling components. Statistically, it is evident from the time series data in the period from 2014 to 2018 on power consumption and production that more power has been incurred while the availability of the pump system is less. 



%Based on the results of testing and reliability analysis, GHD recommends to execute a set of preventive intervention program that involves periodic replacement of pump components and frequent inspection/testing to collect historical data sufficient to estimate the reliability of pumps and the system. %The intervention program can be done in the first year of the next 5 years preventive intervention plan that 

%Based on the results of testing  reliability, and life cycle cost analysis, GHD recommends to execute a set of preventive intervention program that involves periodic replacement of pump components and frequent inspection/testing to collect historical data sufficient to estimate the reliability of pumps and the system. The intervention program can be done in the first year of the next 5 years preventive intervention plan that are reflected in the optimal time window shown along with the impact curves. %The ballpark estimate for the program is about XXX millions Peso, with the IRI and ROI of XXX and YYY, respectively when considering a investment time horizon of XXX years.

%Furthermore, GHD recommends Maynilad that optimal time window to execute the intervention program shall take into consideration of network analysis which will enable Maynilad to set priorities to perform intervention program not only for Pagcor station but also for other stations. In addition, Maynilad might consider to combine intervention programs of a group of stations as it will be also optimal when preparing the bid.
