No. & Items & Remarks \\ 
\hline
1 & Existing piping system & The open space of the above reservoir not well utilized, piping and fittings are compact and barely accomodates conventional measuring devices \\ 
2 & Instrumentation and monitoring & PLC not fully working. Instrumentation/control diagram as proposed from as-built not completely adhered to. Also, MCC is exposed to the ambient conditions rather than in an air-conditioned room \\ 
3 & Plant Layout & The layout of the pump station has many setbacks such as: \\ 
 &  & Wide buffer spaces resulting to poor utilization of plant area,  \\ 
 &  & Need for remote monitoring devices \\ 
 &  & Access and transport difficulties \\ 
4 & Pipe support & Some unsupported pipe runs at pump discharge found in need to be supported to avoid strain on pump casing \\ 
5 & Corrosion & Local corrosions on piping observed  \\
