\section{Fire protection and safety (FDAS) audit} \label{ch04fdas}

%VILLAMOR Pump Station was surveyed for fire protection and safety on 10/30/2018 by the GHD/Alternative Power Solutions Inc. inspection Team. The summary below identifies the major deficiencies that were identified during the inspection. The purpose of this survey was to identify significant fire safety issues and to provide recommendations for remediation based on applicable standards specified by the GHD/APSI. The scope of this initial fire safety inspection was limited to the review and identification of major fire safety issues. The inspection did not include identification of minor deficiencies, which will be further addressed as part of follow-up inspections. Table 1 summarizes the major fire safety issues identified during the inspection. Recommendations have been provided to address each issue. An implementation schedule shall be developed by GHD to remediate each of the findings. The specific timing of improvements, including any requested extensions due to design / installation constraints, shall be submitted to the GHD for approval


\subsection{Fire alarm and detection system} \label{ch04fdas01}
No fire alarm detection system was installed in this PS.

\subsection{Lighting protection system} \label{ch04fdas02}

There is a lightning protection system installed for this in line booster. The strike counter has not registered a single strike. The bare copper wire connecting the lightning arrester to the ground is already dark and corroded.

\subsection{Ground-Fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) or electric leakage circuit breaker (ELCB) or Residual circuit devices (RCD)} \label{ch04fdas03}
\subsubsection{Data and analysis}
No ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) or earth leakage Circuit breaker (ELCB) protection was installed in the panel this PS.
\subsubsection{Recommendations}
Refer to the conceptual design in Chapter \ref{Chapter6}
\subsection{Electrical safety and protective devices} \label{ch04fdas04}
The pump room is only manned by one person. The old pump room was not maintained and not organized.  Staying inside the pump room poses danger to the operator because of the open wiring and exposed live parts. There is only entrance and exit.  




\subsubsection{Data and analysis}
Facts obtained from inspection are presented in Table \ref{ch05_tbl_fdassafe01} with indicative figures for each devices presented in Figure \ref{ch05_fig_fdassafety02}.
