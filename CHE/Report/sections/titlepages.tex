}{% the abstract

Cherry-inline Pump Station is a station with submersible pumps. Based on preliminary assessment on historical corrective and preventive intervention records, it was agreed between Maynilad and GHD to conduct a number of tests per the submitted ITPs. 

%Based on the results of electrical testing GHD recommends to execute a set of preventive intervention program. The intervention program can be done in the first year of the next 5 years preventive intervention plan that are reflected in the optimal time window shown along with the impact curves. %The ballpark estimate for the program is about XXX millions Peso, with the IRI and ROI of XXX and YYY, respectively when considering a investment time horizon of XXX years.

This report describes the electrical and FDAS testing results along with a set of recommendations and conclusions. In brief, it can be recommended that the FDAS system shall be improved for safety reason. In addition, from the harmonic and integrity study, it is optimal to keep a close monitoring on VFD1 to detect any future abnormality in its operation so as to have appropriate preventive and corrective action plan.

This report focuses only on electrical and FDAS testing. Results on mechanical test and life cycle cost estimation will be updated in next revision of this report upon the completion of mechanical tests.

%Furthermore, GHD recommends Maynilad that optimal time window to execute the intervention program shall take into consideration of network analysis which will enable Maynilad to set priorities to perform intervention program not only for Pagcor station but also for other stations. In addition, Maynilad might consider to combine intervention programs of a group of stations as it will be also optimal when preparing the bid.
