	nearly optimal inspection policies are discussed by introducing the
	inspection density and are compared to the existing inspection policies
	with numerical examples. Second, the inspection model with checking
	time and system deterioration is discussed. The algorithms are given
	by using the principle of optimality to seek the optimal inspection
	policies minimizing the total expected discounted costs in two cases
	without and with renewal. The numerical examples are finally presented
	for illustration. },

  abstract = {Pipe wall thickness reduction due to Flow Accelerated Corrosion (FAC)
	depends on mass transfer coefficient (MTC), temperature, pH and roughness.
	The purpose of this research work is to predict the wall thickness
	reduction due to FAC in bends and orifice. The paper proposes a model
	for temporal wall thickness prediction in pipe bend and orifice taking
	into account the positive feedback from FAC induced roughness and
	spatial MTC. This is applied for two geometrical configurations (i)
	FAC experiment performed on 58° carbon steel pipe bend (ii) FAC experiment
	in an orifice with gypsum. In the 58° carbon steel pipe, the predictions
	were in good comparison with the experimental values at different
	locations with percentage error between the predicted and experimental
	wall thickness in the range (−5%, +12%) at all locations on pipe
	extrados. For the orifice, the error was in the range of (−0.3 mm,
	+0.6 mm) at all measured locations. The MTC was estimated using computational
	fluid dynamics (CFD) with k-w SST (shear stress transport) model
	for both configurations. The comparison of predicted values of wall
	thickness with experimental values shows that errors in prediction
	are moderate to low.},
