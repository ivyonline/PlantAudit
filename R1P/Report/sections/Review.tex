\chapter{Preliminary Assessment and Data Gathering} % Write in your own chapter title
\label{Chapter2}
GHD conducted preliminary assessment on a set of data provided by Maynilad. The data set includes a number of records on daily production and power consumption and intervention reports issued after Maynilad experienced failure/breakdown of assets.

The assessment provided a base for GHD to generate the Inspection Testing Plan (ITP) \cite{GHD2018k, GHD2018o} aiming to gather necessary data for conducting reliability study. The ITP has been reviewed by Maynilad, together with the Work Safety Permit (WSP), prior to execution of visual inspections and testings at the site.

\section{Maynilad's data}
\label{21}
Maynilad provided a set of data as shown in Table \ref{mayniladdata}

%\subsection{Summary}
%\label{211}

\subsection{Intervention records}
\label{212}
The current format and structure of the monitoring dashboard somehow presents difficulty in useful and consistent use of the dashboard. Entries are varied and input consistency is low. On which monitoring activity, test and on which part is not readily determined. There is a need browse the item individually. These show that the dashboards may not be really performing its function as a monitoring tool but rather simply is a log with varied maintenance with low consistency. 

Particularly, the most important historical data concerning specific failure of components of pumps with elapsed time is missing. Thus, the provided information is not useful for detailed reliability study on frequent failure of assets at component level. 

The problem with missing specific failure data was due to a matter of fact that Maynilad still has not come up with preventive maintenance program within the overall asset management framework. The IAM team has recently established with expectation to generate short-term, medium-term, and long-term preventive intervention program. In close discussion with Maynilad, GHD learns that Maynilad has a regular/frequent activities for check-up (e.g. monthly and quarterly), however, recorded data has not been digitalized and the data itself has not aligned well with the asset registry. 

There is no significant data to be found on the monitoring dashboard relating to the pumps currently installed in the station since all logs date back before rehabilitation and the pumps were replaced during the rehabilitation. 
%Table \ref{interventiondata} presents highlights on intervention data on pumps.

%In a nutshell, the check-up data is generic and considered to be insignificant for reliability study. However, this conclusion is exceptional for GENSET check-up data, which has been not much in operation since installation.


\subsection{Interview data}
\label{213}
GHD conducted an interview session on 07/12/2018. Results of the interview are summarized in the minutes \cite{GHD2018l}, with the following highlights.

\begin{itemize}
\item No further data is available aside from the provided set presented in earlier section;
\item There is an existing regular check-up for assets but data is not digitalized and the information is only generic;
\item Spare parts are not stocked for most of components, except for bearing. Regarding service delivery, the required discharge pressure remains the top priority in pump operation modulation and sequencing. Critical parts and components for VFD and bearing are usually stacked to have spared in case of emergency repair and replacements. The consumables on the other hand, are not stacked but ordered in advance for use in maintenance activities;
\item No visual bank of assets;
\item No standard testing regime that follows a regular scheme based on optimality;
\item Pumps are operated based on pressure and not manual;
\item No existing PI/CI procedure to be followed;
\item No expansion plan is forecasted;physically impossible to add another pump in the existing pump room
\item There is a problem with the inflow of incoming water, leading to lower level of reservoir chambers that has affected pump operations occasionally;
\item no historical data on pump efficiency, which is a simple yet useful value in determining pump performance. The main impediment in  the individual pump efficiency is the measurement of flow produced by each pump. The existing configuration of the pump-motor and piping system do not cater to conventional methods of flow determination;
\item No intervention records for FDAS. It was revealed that different version on operation and functionality of the FDAS was reported by both guard and site operators.
%\item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Asset hierarchy}
\label{214}
During the bidding phase, Maynilad did provide the first draft of the Asset Registry (AR) that describes a hierarchy of eight (8) levels. Figure \ref{ch02_assethierachy} visualizes the hierarchy with brief description presented in Table \ref{ch02_tbl_assethierachy}.

\begin{table}[h]

	{\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{l|p{10cm}}
	\hline
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Asset hierarchy} & Description \\ 
	\hline
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Level 1} & Stakeholder level. For example, an pump station belongs to MWSI \\ 
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Level 2} & Geographical locations/ or administrative zone (e.g. a pump station belong to Quezon city or Makati) \\ 
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Level 3} & System (e.g. the entire pump stations and reservoir system) \\ 
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Level 4} & Sub-system (e.g. one specific pump station and reservoir such as the Lamesa PSR) \\ 
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Level 5} & Functional system (e.g. booster system or storage system) \\ 
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Level 6} & Component (e.g. Suction line, Reservoir line and Tank) \\ 
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Level 7} & Sub-component (e.g. Suction pipe and fittings, Concrete reservoir, pump) \\ 
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Level 8} & Items (e.g. valve, bearing, motor) \\ 
	\hline
\end{tabular}		
	}
\end{table}

GHD received the latest version of the AR with 101 assets for this PS. The full list of assets is given in the excel file provided by Maynilad in 2018. GHD has developed a MS Access program to convert the data in the excel file to a relational database structure. Per agreement with Maynilad, GHD will only verify level 7 of the AR with the actual site condition for the study \cite{GHD2018m}. 
\section{Preliminary assessment}
\label{22}
Assessment on the lastest provided intervention records reveals that the provided pertinent data is incomplete and cannot be used as representative data for a complete reliability study. %However, the behaviour of the data can give a glimmer on the reliability of the PS. This glim can be seen in Figure  \ref{ch02_distributionofintervention2017} 

%The statistics infers that there are numerous major CIs that did incurred in just one year. CI also infers that there are loss in Revenue, Reputation, and Regulatory (3Rs) that Maynilad could have been suffered. This 3Rs has not been addressed in the historical data.

%Further table study indicates that the pump system fails due to a number of failures of its items, which are shown in Table \ref{ch02_tbl_failure}.
%
%\begin{table}[h]

%\end{table}

It is also confirmed from the provided data that the Client has done regularly check-up on GENSETs to ensure that it provides adequate level of services in case of emergency. To date, no failure records has been observed for the GENSET.%The statistic on check-up and routine cleaning and inspection of the GENSETs is shown in Table \ref{ch02_tbl_gensets}

%\begin{table}[h]

%	\hline
%\end{tabular}
%	}
%\end{table}

%As can be seen from Table \ref{ch02_tbl_failure}, majority of pump maintenance involves vibration both as a source and/or a result. Problems with alignment, bearings and couplings make up more than half of the maintenance work and are mostly associated with vibration (Figure \ref{ch02_interventionitem2017}). Minimizing vibration will lead to less damage to components and better maintenance of components will reduce unwanted vibrations during pump operation. A thought to be noted is the association of failures between pump parts in that failure in one promotes succeeding failures of the others.

%From reliability point of view, having frequency CIs indicates a level of uncertainty that the PS does not provide adequate level of services (LOS).

Further evaluations and tests have to be conducted to identify the areas for improvement of preventive measures in mitigating corrective measures and study the ways to strengthen preventive measures to improve operating conditions and life of pump components. 

Improving the reliability of the pump stations for the next coming years require evaluation of the existing pump station conditions and maintenance practices, particularly assessment of the pump and its components. With that, areas for improvement of operation and maintenance be addressed through action items that come from the resulting recommendations.

In order to capture a relatively good picture on the reliability of the pump system and its associated assets, a number of tests shall be conducted. 

\section{Summary of the inspection test plan (ITP)}
\label{231}
A complete write-up on testing shall be referred to the ITP \cite{GHD2018k,GHD2018o}, which has been submitted, reviewed, and approved by the Client. This section only provides highlights to help readers keeping abread of the flow of the report.

\subsection{Mechanical Audit}
\label{232}
The Mechanical Tests to be conducted are enumerated and discussed hereunder including their background and applications, standards used if applicable, and the equipment to be used. During testing, the following are the assumptions and considerations:

\begin{itemize}
\item The operation of the pumps cannot be interrupted (at day time when demand is high).
\item The valve settings then cannot be adjusted to produce different flow rates.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Structural Inspection for Pump Discharge and Suction Line}

This activity measures the current thickness of the existing pipelines at the pump vicinity using ultrasonic thickness gauging. The flow regime especially around the elbow and possibly corrosion and scaling conditions are to be predicted from the measurements of this test.

Following procedures will be executed

\paragraph{Step 1: Locate and mark testing points}
At a minimum of two (2) meters away from the pump intake/discharge flange, the test points shall be marked at 3, 6, 9 and 12 o’clock positions and at one (1) meter interval along the pipes, additional test sections with same set points shall be added as long as available beneath the immediate ground level (Figure \ref{ch02_samplepumptestpoints01} and Figure \ref{ch02_samplepumptestpoints02}). Note that there will be no testing at sections indicated in the figure as it falls on the control valve. The next 1 meter away from the pump flange will be considered instead.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/ch02_samplepumptestpoints01} \\
	\caption{Tentative pump layout and testing points}
	\label{ch02_samplepumptestpoints01}

	\caption{Tentative pump testing points}
	\label{ch02_samplepumptestpoints02} 
\end{figure}

The test points shall also consider elbows on probable points of most thinning from turbulent water flow.

\paragraph{Step 2: Prepare test point surfaces}
\begin{itemize}
\item	Wipe the surface free of dirt (no need to remove paint)
\item	Using a chalkstone (erasable), mark x on the test point
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Step 3: Apply sufficient couplant on test point surface}
\begin{itemize}
\item	Use petroleum jelly/Vaseline as couplant
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Step 4: Set transducer probe on test point}

\paragraph{Step 5: Read and record value as indicated on module display} (Figure \ref{ch02_utgreading} - 1 and Figure \ref{ch02_utgreading} - 2)

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Step 6: Clean test point after reading}

\subsubsection{Unit Flow Measurement}
The activity measures pump capacities. Pump efficiency is then calculated using the measured values.  

\paragraph{Step 1: Locate Sensor Position Point Area and mark all points to be taken.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Observe required offset distance from fittings/pump to consider the fully developed flow. At least 10 times the diameter distance away from the suction/discharge of the pump if applicable, otherwise consider at least 2D distance away from the fittings. This is to ensure the flow will be stable and fully developed for flow measurement accuracy (Figure \ref{ch02_flowmeasurement01} - a and Figure \ref{ch02_flowmeasurement02} - b).
\item Otherwise, test at near turbulent zones and consider normalizing the flow. 
\end{itemize}

    \end{minipage}
	\caption{Flow measurement using UFM}
	\label{ch02_flowmeasurement02}
\end{figure}



\paragraph{Step 2: Pipe Specification Input on the Flow Meter.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Identify nominal pipe size with equivalent parameters such as schedule designation, equivalent thickness, OD, and etc.
\item Input outside diameter.
\item Input pipe thickness.
\item Input pipe material (carbon steel).
\item Input pipe medium (water).

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Step 3: Prepare test point surfaces}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Clean the surface of pipe with a sandpaper and steel brush or any suitable abrasive materials, exposing the base metal.
	
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Step 4: Install transducers at set points}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Apply enough couplant that it covers transducers sensors to ensure an acoustically conductive connection to the pipe. Also apply couplant on the test point surface %(Figure \ref{ch02_flowmeasurement03}).
	\item Clamp the transducers at the side of pipe using metal chains, straps or mounting rails Observing proper spacing and alignment. Note flow direction and install transducers at either 0 or 45 degrees, whichever would give more stable reading %(Figure \ref{ch02_flowmeasurement04}, Figure \ref{ch02_flowmeasurement05}, Figure \ref{ch02_flowmeasurement06})
	\item Wait for the module to display “System Normal” before reading. Inspect set-up for any fault and properly reinstall if signal is poor/low (no reading)

\paragraph{Step 5: Data gathering}
Read and record all necessary data measurement by the equipment, (i.e. flow, fluid velocity, sound velocity, Reynolds number, etc.)

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Step 6: Remove transducers and restore paints}
Remove the transducers and restore the surface of pipe after measurement.

\subsubsection{Suction and Discharge Pressure Measurement}
The activity measures each pump suction and discharge pressure. The pump efficiency is then calculated using the measured values.

\paragraph{Step 1: Disassembly of existing Pressure Gauge}
\begin{itemize}
\item Inspect for any leaks or unusual noise before proceeding: If anything is detected, report immediately to the operator;
\item 	Close gate valve located before the pressure gauge and wait for the pressure reading to drop;
\item 	Remove the pressure gauge: (1) Hold the adapter steady with one wrench and the grip the stationary socket of the pressure gauge with another; (2) Loosen the pressure gauge then remove it.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Step 2: Installing the Pressure Gauge}
\begin{itemize}
\item Prepare the connections: (1) Clean the connections before installing; (2) Put Teflon tape on the pressure connection of the gauge;
\item Install the pressure gauge: (1) Mount the pressure gauge on the adapter then hand tighten the arrangement; (2) Further tighten the assembly using a pair of wrenches: hold the adapter steady with one wrench and the grip the stationary socket of the pressure gauge with another; (3) Tighten the assembly;
\item Inspect the assembly again.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Step 3: Reading the pressure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Slowly open the gate valve: Observe any leaks or unusual noise;
\item Measurement: (1) Wait until reading is stable; (2) Record the pressure as indicated.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Step 4: Restoring the earlier gauge}
\begin{itemize}
\item Inspect for any leaks or unusual noise before proceeding: If anything is detected, report immediately to the operator;
\item 	Close gate valve located before the pressure gauge and wait for the pressure reading to drop;
\item Remove the pressure gauge: (1) Hold the adapter steady with one wrench and the grip the stationary socket of the pressure gauge with another; (2) Loosen the pressure gauge then remove it;
\item 	Prepare the connections: (1) Clean the connections before installing; (2) Put Teflon tape on the pressure connection of the gauge;
\item 	Install the pressure gauge;
\item 	Mount the pressure gauge on the adapter then hand tighten the arrangement;
\item 	Further tighten the assembly using a pair of wrenches: hold the adapter steady with one wrench and the grip the stationary socket of the pressure gauge with another;
\item 	Tighten the assembly.
\end{itemize}

%Maynilad sent 2 WEM service reports, the first was conducted last November 6 and December 20, 2013, and the second on November 11 2015 and January 20, 2016. The WEM methodology included the measurements of Total Nuisance Dust (TND) concentration, temperature and relative humidity, illumination and noise levels. The tests were done inside the office and on the booster area where the pumps operate.

%Results of the tests show that the office premises are well below the minimum count for TND concentrations, above the minimum recommended lighting requirement and below the permissible noise level as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Standards of DOLE. The booster area complies satisfactorily for minimum recommended lighting requirement; the noise level as measures exceeds the permissible level and so requires ear safety protection whenever in the area
GHD/RBSanchez conducted WEM tests at designated locations (Figure \ref{ch02_wem01}) to record values of parameters presented in Table \ref{ch02_tbl_wemparameter}.

\section{Database}
\label{24}
GHD developed an MS Access program that functions as a database used to record data collected from visual inspections and testings. The database has been developed using the concept of Relational Database Management System (RDMS), which is a must to record data systematically. The benefits of using the database are

\begin{itemize}
\item Eliminate redundancy and repetition of same data
\item Eliminate incorrect data entry that is often found when working with excel files
\item Provide linkages among asset hierarchy
\item Provide ease for programing (e.g. reliability modeling and life cycle cost analysis)
\item Support Maynilad AIM team to learn the benefits of using RDMS in developing an integrated Asset Management System for now and future
\item Provide compatibility with any CMMS that is often using other RDMS such as Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle SQL server, or MySQL platform
\item Provide ease for compilation of desire tables for further analysis using SQL (Structure Query Language)
\item Provide ease for importing/exporting to different extension formats (e.g. flat, csv, xlsx)
\item Provide a strong background for Maynilad team to migrate recording practices to Web-based that will be part of GHD's recommendation for future usage.
