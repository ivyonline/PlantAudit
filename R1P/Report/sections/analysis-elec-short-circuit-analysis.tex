\section{Short circuit calculations and evaluation} \label{ch04_elecaudit_shortcuircuitanalysis}
\subsection{Short circuit calculation}
Short circuit calculation (SCC) has been done using the software ETAP version 16.2 under following considerations:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Available MVA Short Circuit}: Utility supplying normal power to the PS  via a 34.5 KV line is MERALCO. The maximum projected fault is to be requested by the owner from the utility. In the calculation, 1000MVA available short circuit was used;

\item \textbf{Transformer}: The SCC was based on a  750kVA transformer  feeding the transfer switch going to the motors. Transformer impedance used in the calculation is per standard;

\item \textbf{GENSET}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Emergency power will be supplied by 1 Genset, rated at 770 kVA feeding downstream distribution power lines;% busduct;% to synchronizing  panel;

\item Subtransient value of the generator should be provided for a more  accurate calculation. 

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Length of wires and cables}: Actual measured length of wires and cables.

\end{itemize}

Calculation has been done for Three Phase of short circuit current. Results of the calculations are summarized in Table \ref{tbl_ch04_elecaudit_scc}. Figure \ref{fig_ch04_elecaudit_scc_lgfault} and Figure \ref{fig_ch04_elecaudit_scc_3phase} represent the graphical representation of Nodes and Links as well as associated values.

The values of SCC shown in the table indicates the followings:

\begin{itemize}
\item the values of the FAULT observed to be lower than the values of the protective devices. This infers that the existing protective devices are capable to protect the assets.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation of protective devices and bus bars}
It can be interpreted from the results of the SCC that 
\begin{itemize}
\item the protective devices and bus bars are still provided adequate level of services and performed per applied standards;

\item there is no undersized electrical components.
\end{itemize}
