\section{Protection coordination study} \label{ch04_elecaudit_protectioncoordination}
In protection coordination study, the protective devices nearest to the FAULT shall trip first and the remaining of the protective devices shall not be affected. The results were obtained from the ETAB software and shown in Table \ref{ch04_elecaudit_protectioncoordination01}, Table \ref{ch04_elecaudit_protectioncoordination02}, and Table \ref{ch04_elecaudit_protectioncoordination03}.

Further illustration of the coordination is shown in Figure \ref{fig_ch04_elecaudit_protection_coordination01}.

Following remarks/recommendations can be interpreted from values shown in the tables and figure.

\begin{itemize}
\item Trip curve is covered by other protective functions or clipped by fault current.

\item Some of the Circuit breaker trip devices are fixed and can not be adjusted. Hence coordination is deemed to be partial since some of the  branch breaker TCC curves crossed the TCC curve of Main breaker on the instantaneous region.

\item L-G fault coordination is not possible. Trip unit of protective device has no ground fault protection provided due to the type of breaker supplied. However , this is allowed under the Philippine Electrical Code.

\item For better coordination, main breaker should be of adjustable and electronic type.


\end{itemize}
