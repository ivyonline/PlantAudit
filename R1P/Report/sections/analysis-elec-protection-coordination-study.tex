\section{Protection coordination study} \label{ch04_elecaudit_protectioncoordination}
In protection coordination study, the protective devices nearest to the FAULT shall trip first and the remaining of the protective devices shall not be affected. The results were obtained from the ETAB software and shown in Table \ref{ch04_elecaudit_protectioncoordination01}, Table \ref{ch04_elecaudit_protectioncoordination02}, and Tables \ref{ch04_elecaudit_protectioncoordination03a}, \ref{ch04_elecaudit_protectioncoordination03b}, and \ref{ch04_elecaudit_protectioncoordination03c}.

Further illustration of the coordination is shown in Figure \ref{fig_ch04_elecaudit_protection_coordination01}.

Following remarks/recommendations can be interpreted from values shown in the tables and figure.

\begin{itemize}
\item Trip curve of CB2 is covered by CB4 in the instantaneous region. Hence coordination is deemed to be partial since the feeder breaker CB4 TCC curve crossed the TCC curve of Main breaker on the instantaneous region. For better coordination, main breaker should be of higher trip unit model wherein the instantaneous region is not fixed and can be defeated. .

\item Almost all feeder circuit breaker trip devices are fixed and can not be adjusted but are well coordinated with upstream breaker CB4. L-G fault protection not possible. Trip unit of protective device has no ground fault protection due to the type of breaker supplied. However , this is allowed under the Philippine Electrical Code.

\end{itemize}
