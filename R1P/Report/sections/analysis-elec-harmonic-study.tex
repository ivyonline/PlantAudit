\section{Harmonic study} \label{ch04_elecaudit_harmonicstudy}
Harmonic study has been conducted under the following basics
\begin{itemize}
\item Harmonics shall be defined as sinusoidal voltage and currents having frequencies that are integral multiples of the fundamental frequency;

\item The total harmonic distortion (THD) shall be defined as the ratio of the RMS value of the harmonic content to the RMS value of the fundamental quantity, expressed in percent;

\item PHILIPPINE DISTRIBUTION CODE sets the THD of the voltage at any user 	system to not exceed 5\% during normal operating conditions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{As per design}
Results of the study as per design are shown in Figure \ref{fig_ch04_elecaudit_harmonic_waveform} and Figure \ref{fig_ch04_elecaudit_harmonic_load_flow}

It can be seen from the figures that there are a number of distortions, which are connected to bus6. It is notable to observe that the percentage of the THD is 18.66\%, which is way above the acceptable limit of 5\%. The current harmonics have high values as per design.


\subsection{Per actual}
Results of the study based on the PQA are presented in Figures shown in the Appendix \ref{app_pqa} and \ref{app_ha} with summary shown in Table \ref{tbl_ch04_elecaudit_powerquality_thdcompliance}, with the min, average, and max values are presented along with the limit of 5\%.


%\input{tables/tbl_ch04_elecaudit_harmonicstudy}

It can be interpreted from the table that values Main, VFD1 VFD2, and softstarter  are within the acceptable limits. The low value of Harmonics (THD)  can be attributed to the Harmonic filter installed inside the switchgear. However, the Total Demand Distortion values remain high as per acutal .Recommendation shall be realized together with the recommendation from the study of Power Quality Analysis 

Recommendation shall be realized together with the recommendation from the study of Power Quality Analysis (refer to subsection \ref{ch04_elecaudit_powerquality})
