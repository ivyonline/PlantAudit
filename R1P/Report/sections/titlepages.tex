}{% the abstract

The station was received a major rehabilitation/upgrade in 2017, thus, there has not progressive deterioration and degradation observed to date. The study was based on preliminary assessment on historical corrective and preventive intervention records prior to 2017 together with the operational data. 

Based on the results of testing and reliability analysis, GHD recommends to execute a set of preventive intervention program that involves periodic replacement of pump components and frequent inspection/testing to collect historical data sufficient to estimate the reliability of pumps and the system. 


Furthermore, GHD recommends Maynilad that optimal time window to execute the intervention program shall take into consideration of network analysis which will enable Maynilad to set priorities to perform intervention program not only for Pagcor station but also for other stations. In addition, Maynilad might consider to combine intervention programs of a group of stations as it will be also optimal when preparing the bid.
