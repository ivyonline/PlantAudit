No. & Items & Remarks \\ 
\hline
1 & Suction pipe design & May promote turbulent flow profile which is not benefitial to long term pump operation \\ 
2 & Water velocity & Velocity of water pipes exceed recommended maximum fluid velocity and will shorten pipe life.  \\ 
3 & As-built changes & Few modifications and major omissions (air valve and STC) from the design was observed. Some need to be address to improve performance and life of both pump and pipes \\ 
4 & Discharge pipe & Excessive local deterioration via corrosion which is a potential source of leak in the future. PRV Lever experiences excessive galvanic corrosion and is very unaesthetic. Old pipes have deteriorated contrasted to the younger pipes. Corrosion is very noticeable \\ 
5 & Air valve & No air valve installed on either discharge or suction side of pump \\ 
6 & Discharge isolation valve near ceiling & Has no handle and maybe useless due to inacessibility \\ 
7 & Machine foundation and available space & Old foundation block remains, new foundation block raises pump centerline with purpose of increasing available space to fit valves and special connections \\
