	No. & Items & CS & Remarks \\ 

\hline
1 & Double elbow suction 1 & 3 & Design may promote turbulent flow profile which is not benefitial to long term pump operation \\ 
2 & Suction 2 & 1 & Use of existing pipe line might not be benefitial as it promotes turbulence due to design and is not desired for pump operation \\ 
3 & Suction FC & 1 & Connection is serving its purpose to accommodate minor displacements however connection to adjacent pipe need to be replaced with a diffuser to minimize hydraulic losses\\ 
4 & Discharge FC & 1 & Connection is serving its purpose to accommodate minor displacements \\ 
5 & Check valve & 1 & Check valve is relatively new, no leaks or signs of corrosion, no malfunction observed \\ 
6 & Discharge BV & 1 & No malfunction observed \\ 
7 & Machine foundation & 1 & Damping capacity of foundation based on rule of thumb is adequate, raises machine inertia due to height  \\ 
8 & Vibration probes & 1 & Probes are working properly \\
