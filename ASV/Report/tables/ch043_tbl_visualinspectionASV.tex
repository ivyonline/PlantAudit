\hline
No. & Items & CS & Remarks \\ 
\hline
1 & Suction header and takeoff line & 1 & Has ample size for tapping additional pumps in the future \\ 
2 & BV (suction side) & 1 & Valve is working \\ 
3 & Y-check valve & 3 & Opened during pump start up in place of air vent. Position however near the pump intake is not desired due to increase in water turbulence \\ 
4 & FC (suction side) & 1 & Installed as required \\ 
5 & FC (discharge side) & 1 & Installed as required \\ 
6 & STC & 3 & Serves same function of FC and is therefore redundant \\ 
7 & BV (discharge side) & 1 & Valve is working \\ 
8 & Supply header and joining line & 1 & Y connection help reduces hydraulic thrust and flow resistance \\ 
9 & Pump vibration isolation system & 3 & Not appropriate for the given system and surroundings \\ 
10 & Pump Foundation & 2 & Single slab with multiple slots. No computation for machine foundation found on provided data \\
