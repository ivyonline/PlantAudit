1 & Elbow after pump discharge & 2 & Need to be supported  \\ 
2 & CV & 1 & No leakage found \\ 
3 & STC with harness & 1 & Reduces hydraulic thrust on header by allowing minute axial displacement along pipe \\ 
4 & Header and joining line & 1 & Joining section via Y connection and long radius miter bend used at later section of discharge header help reduce hydraulic thrust and resistance \\ 
5 & Bypass line & 2 & Not fully bolted at base for bypass line of Pump 2; corrosion of flange and bolts observed \\
