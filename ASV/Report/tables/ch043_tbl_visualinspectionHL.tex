No. & Items & Remarks \\ 
\hline
1 & Existing suction pipe and fittings & Suction line too short and is jam packed with fittings. Does not promote good flow development. Intake water will be turbulent and is not desired \\ 
2 & Discharge piping and fittings & Pressure gauge near pump discharge is prefered for measuring head of indivual pump \\ 
2 & Pump vibration isolation  & Does not appropriately serve its function to isolate vibration from building and reduce noise \\ 
3 & As built difference & Actual system contain many differences from provided copy of old as-built including valve positions and pipe design \\ 
4 & Pump foundation block & Unitary block with multiple slots and may  \\ 
5 & Space & Modifications for improvement are possible because of available space inside pump room \\ 
6 & Instrumentation and monitoring & Pump instrumentation do not include PLC and other important parameters typically displayed by PLC not monitored \\
