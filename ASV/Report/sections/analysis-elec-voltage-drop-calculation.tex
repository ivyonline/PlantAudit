\section{Voltage drop calculation} \label{ch04_elecaudit_voltagedropcalculation}
Voltage drop calculation (VDC) has been conducted in compliance with the code (PEC 2017 ARTICLE 2.15.1.2(A)(1)(b)FPN NO.2) which states the following


\begin{itemize}
	\item Conductors  for feeders, as defined in Article1.1, sized to prevent a voltage drop exceeding 3\% at the farthest outlet of power, heating and lighting loads, or combinations of such
	loads, and where the maximum total voltage drop on both feeders and branch circuits to the  
	farthest outlet does not exceed 5\% , will provide reasonable efficiency.
	
\end{itemize}

Results of the VDC is presented in Table \ref{tbl_ch04_elecaudit_vdc}

\input{tables/tbl_ch04_elecaudit_vdc}

It can be interpreted from the values of the calculation that the VDC is within the limits defined in the applied standard.
