Results of the study are shown in Table \ref{tbl_ch04_elecaudit_groundsystem} with the following note:

\begin{itemize}
\item The resistance between the main grounding electrode and ground should be no greater
than five ohms for large commercial or industrial systems and 1.0 ohm or less for generating or transmission station grounds unless otherwise specified by the owner. (Reference ANSI/IEEE Standard 142)
 
\end{itemize}
