\section{Electrical system design and analysis} \label{ch04_elecaudit_systemdesign}
\subsection{Basics}
In accordance with Article 1.3 Electrical Plans and specifications of the Philippine Electrical Code 2017 Edition, Electrical design analysis shall be included and submitted separately together with the electrical plans. These includes the followings:

\begin{enumerate}%[label=\alph*)]
\item Branch circuits, sub-feeders, feeders, busways, and service entrance;
\item Types, ratings, and trip settings of overload protective device;
\item Calculation of voltage drops;
\item	Calculation of short circuit current for determining the interrupting capacity of overcurrent protective device for residential, commercial and industrial establishment;
\item	Protection coordination of overcurrent protective devices;
\item	ARC-flash Hazard Analysis to determine the required personal protective equipment (PPE).
\end{enumerate}

ARC flash Hazard Analysis is required and is intended for concerned parties to be informed and made aware of the importance of personal protective equipment (PPE) and its type for the flash hazard risk category determined by the analysis (refer to Table \ref{tbl_ch04_elecaudit_arcflash}).

\subsection{Results}
Results are briefly presented in the following subsections. Details reports generated by the software are enclosed as part of the Appendix of this report (can also be an electronic files)

\subsubsection{Branch circuits, sub-feeders, feeders and service entrance}
Figure \ref{fig_ch04_elecaudit_SLD_with_VFD} shows the SLD with values associated with each nodes and links.

\subsubsection{Types, ratings, and trip settings of overload protective device}
Types, ratings, and trip settings of overload protective devices are shown in Table \ref{tbl_ch04_elecaudit_tripsetting}

\input{tables/tbl_ch04_elecaudit_tripsetting}



\subsubsection{Calculation of voltage drops }
Basic for analysis is per PEC 2017 ARTICLE 2.15.1.2(A)(1)(b)FPN NO.2, which states "Conductors  for feeders, as defined in Article1.1, sized to prevent a voltage drop exceeding three 
(3) percent at the farthest outlet of power, heating and lighting loads, or combinations of such
loads,and where the maximum total voltage drop on both feeders and branch circuits to the  
farthest outlet does not exceed five (5) percent , will provide reasonable efficiency.".

Results of voltage drop are summarized in Table \ref{tbl_ch04_elecaudit_votagedrop}
\input{tables/tbl_ch04_elecaudit_votagedrop}


\subsubsection{Calculation of short circuit current 3-PHASE}
Table \ref{tbl_ch04_elecaudit_shortcircuitsummary} show summaries of results on short circuit.

\end{table}


\subsubsection{Protection coordination of overcurrent protective devices}
Results of study on protection coordination are presented in subsection \ref{ch04_elecaudit_protectioncoordination}. With reference to the coordination plot shown in Figure \ref{fig_ch04_elecaudit_protection_coordination01}, it is remarked that partial coordination only for the main and feeder breakers. TCC of feeders crosses the TCC of enclosed circuit breaker upstream of the feeders. Trip curve is covered by other protective functions or clipped by fault current.

\subsection{Recommendations}
According to the results of the Arc Flash Analysis, Cotton underclothing plus FR shirt, pants, plus multi-layer switching suit or equivalent should be worn when opening the cover of the MCC. Arc flash Boundary (AFB)  is about 8 feet (2.44 meters).  Contributors to the arc flash are the motor loads and the VFDâ€™s.

An Arc flash label (refer to Figure \ref{fig_ch04_elecaudit_arflashlable}) should be placed on the MCC as per requirement of the Philippine Electrical code.
