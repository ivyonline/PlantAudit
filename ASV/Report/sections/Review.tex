\chapter{Preliminary Assessment and Data Gathering} % Write in your own chapter title
\label{Chapter2}
GHD conducted preliminary assessment on a set of data provided by Maynilad. The data set includes a number of records on daily production and power consumption and intervention reports issued after Maynilad experienced failure/breakdown of assets.

The assessment provided a base for GHD to generate the Inspection Testing Plan (ITP) \cite{GHD2018j} aiming to gather necessary data for conducting reliability study. The ITP has been reviewed by Maynilad, together with the Work Safety Permit (WSP), prior to execution of visual inspections and testings at the site.

\section{Maynilad's data}
\label{21}
Maynilad provided a set of data as shown in Table \ref{mayniladdata}

\begin{table}[h]

\end{table}

%\subsection{Summary}
%\label{211}

\subsection{Intervention records}
\label{212}
There are no CI reports for this station. Furthermore, the most important historical data concerning specific failure of components of pumps with elapsed time is missing. Thus, the provided information is not useful for detailed reliability study on frequent failure of assets at component level. 

The problem with missing specific failure data was due to a matter of fact that Maynilad still has not come up with preventive maintenance program within the overall asset management framework. The IAM team has recently established with expectation to generate short-term, medium-term, and long-term preventive intervention program. In close discussion with Maynilad, GHD learns that Maynilad has a regular/frequent activities for check-up (e.g. monthly and quarterly), however, recorded data has not been digitalized and the data itself has not aligned well with the asset registry. 

Table \ref{interventiondata} presents highlights on intervention data on pumps.

			\hline
			Pump & Description of PI/CI & Date/Remarks \\ 
			\hline
			All Pumps & Inspection of pump drive coupling, mechanical seal, MCC components. Conducted pump and motor vibration test using vibration meter and monitored bearing condition using thermal scanner. Also check gen-set's engine oil, radiator's coolant, battery solutions and filters. & Regular monthly maintenance activity, may vary at times depending on availability of test equipment \\

\end{table}



\subsection{Interview data}
\label{213}
GHD conducted an interview session on 07/12/2018. Results of the interview are summarized in the minutes \cite{GHD2018l}, with the following highlights.

\begin{itemize}
\item No further data is available aside from the provided set presented in earlier section;
\item There is an existing regular check-up for assets but data is not digitalized and the information is only generic;
\item Spare parts are not stocked for most of components, except for bearing. Regarding service delivery, the required discharge pressure remains the top priority in pump operation modulation and sequencing. Critical parts and components for VFD and bearing are usually stacked to have spared in case of emergency repair and replacements. The consumables on the other hand, are not stacked but ordered in advance for use in maintenance activities;
\item No visual bank of assets;
\item No standard testing regime that follows a regular scheme based on optimality;
\item Pumps are operated based on pressure and not manual;
\item No existing PI/CI procedure to be followed;
\item No expansion plan is forecasted; physically impossible to add another pump in the existing pump room
\item There is a problem with the inflow of incoming water, leading to lower level of reservoir chambers that has affected pump operations occasionally;
\item no historical data on pump efficiency, which is a simple yet useful value in determining pump performance. The main impediment in  the individual pump efficiency is the measurement of flow produced by each pump. The existing configuration of the pump-motor and piping system do not cater to conventional methods of flow determination;
\item No intervention records for FDAS. It was revealed that different version on operation and functionality of the FDAS was reported by both guard and site operators.
%\item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Asset hierarchy}
\label{214}
During the bidding phase, Maynilad did provide the first draft of the Asset Registry (AR) that describes a hierarchy of eight (8) levels. Figure \ref{ch02_assethierachy} visualizes the hierarchy with brief description presented in Table \ref{ch02_tbl_assethierachy}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\end{figure}

\begin{table}[h]
	\caption{Condition state definition - Multiple.}
	\label{ch02_tbl_assethierachy}
	{\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{l|p{10cm}}
	\hline
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Asset hierarchy} & Description \\ 
	\hline
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Level 1} & Stakeholder level. For example, an pump station belongs to MWSI \\ 
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Level 2} & Geographical locations/ or administrative zone (e.g. a pump station belong to Quezon city or Makati) \\ 
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Level 3} & System (e.g. the entire pump stations and reservoir system) \\ 
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Level 4} & Sub-system (e.g. one specific pump station and reservoir such as the Lamesa PSR) \\ 
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Level 5} & Functional system (e.g. booster system or storage system) \\ 
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Level 6} & Component (e.g. Suction line, Reservoir line and Tank) \\ 
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Level 7} & Sub-component (e.g. Suction pipe and fittings, Concrete reservoir, pump) \\ 
	\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Level 8} & Items (e.g. valve, bearing, motor) \\ 
	\hline
\end{tabular}		
	}
\end{table}

GHD received the latest version of the AR with about 100 assets for this PS. The full list of assets is given in the excel file provided by Maynilad in 2018. GHD has developed a MS Access program to convert the data in the excel file to a relational database structure. Per agreement with Maynilad, GHD will only verify level 7 of the AR with the actual site condition for the study \cite{GHD2018m}. 
\section{Preliminary assessment}
\label{22}
Assessment on the latest provided intervention records reveals that the provided pertinent data is incomplete and cannot be used as representative data for a complete reliability study. 

It is also confirmed from the provided data that the Client has done regularly check-up on GENSETs to ensure that it provides adequate level of services in case of emergency. To date, no failure records has been observed for the GENSET.

Further evaluations and tests have to be conducted to identify the areas for improvement of preventive measures in mitigating corrective measures and study the ways to strengthen preventive measures to improve operating conditions and life of pump components. 

Improving the reliability of the pump stations for the next coming years require evaluation of the existing pump station conditions and maintenance practices, particularly assessment of the pump and its components. With that, areas for improvement of operation and maintenance be addressed through action items that come from the resulting recommendations.

In order to capture a relatively good picture on the reliability of the pump system and its associated assets, a number of tests shall be conducted. 

\section{Summary of the inspection test plan (ITP)}
\label{231}
A complete write-up on testing shall be referred to the ITP \cite{GHD2018j}, which has been submitted, reviewed, and approved by the Client. This section only provides highlights to help readers keeping abreast  of the flow of the report.

\subsection{Vibration and structural assessment}
\label{235}
This activity measures the vibrations of the pump and motor at the drive and non-drive ends. The data will be used to address pump vibration problems such as cavitation, pump flow pulsation, bent pump shaft, pump impeller imbalance, shaft misalignment and bearing problems.

Following procedures will be executed

\paragraph{Step 1: Test location identification}

Locate the testing points on drive and non-drive ends of pump and motor %(Figure \ref{ch02_vibrationtest01}).

\paragraph{Step 2: Set transducer probe on test point. Observe HIRAC for access to elevated positions}
\paragraph{Step 3: Read and record value as indicated on module display (Figure \ref{fig_ch02_vib} - d)}

\section{Electrical Audit}
The detail of the electrical audit testing procedure is presented in the Inspection Testing Plant (ITP) \cite{GHD2018j}, which has been submitted to Maynilad along with the WSPs and were approved prior to the execution of tests.

\section{Database}
\label{24}
GHD developed an MS Access program that functions as a database used to record data collected from visual inspections and testings. The database has been developed using the concept of Relational Database Management System (RDMS), which is a must to record data systematically. The benefits of using the database are

\begin{itemize}
	\item Eliminate redundancy and repetition of same data
	\item Eliminate incorrect data entry that is often found when working with excel files
	\item Provide linkages among asset hierarchy
	\item Provide ease for programing (e.g. reliability modeling and life cycle cost analysis)
	\item Support Maynilad AIM team to learn the benefits of using RDMS in developing an integrated Asset Management System for now and future
	\item Provide compatibility with any CMMS that is often using other RDMS such as Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle SQL server, or MySQL platform
	\item Provide ease for compilation of desire tables for further analysis using SQL (Structure Query Language)
	\item Provide ease for importing/exporting to different extension formats (e.g. flat, csv, xlsx)
	\item Provide a strong background for Maynilad team to migrate recording practices to Web-based that will be part of GHD's recommendation for future usage.
\end{itemize}

The MySQL database is then migrated into MySQL server, which is powerful database system that is used also to migrate, compile, and store all production and power consumption data into a single table. Main reasons behind the development of the MySQL server are for statistical computing with R and for faster compilation of queries.

GHD will provide these two sets of database as part of our deliverable and will provide training for Maynilad team to learn how to use the database in an efficient approach.
